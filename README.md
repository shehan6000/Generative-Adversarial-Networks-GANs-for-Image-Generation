# Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for Image Generation

This project demonstrates the implementation of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) using PyTorch to generate realistic images from noise. The GAN is trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset, which consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes.



## Overview

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) consist of two neural networks, the Generator and the Discriminator, which compete against each other. The Generator creates fake images from random noise, and the Discriminator tries to distinguish between real and fake images. Through this adversarial process, the Generator learns to produce increasingly realistic images.
